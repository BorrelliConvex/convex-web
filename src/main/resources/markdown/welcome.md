# Convex

Convex is a global platform for trusted applications and digital assets.

## Why Convex?

### Convex is Flexible

Convex is well suited as a platform for applications that need to be 100% secure and also publicly verifiable (both in terms of data and application behaviour).

Some examples:

- Public registries and databases
- Digital currencies
- Prediction markets
- Immutable provenance records
- Smart contracts for managing digital assets

### Convex is Fast

With a novel consensus algorithm, Convex can execute decentralised applications at internet scale. Using normal consumer-grade hardware and network bandwidth the network can achieve:

- Thousands of digitally signed transactions per second (more than the 1,700 transactions per second typically handled by the VISA network)
- Ability to execute over a million operations per second on the CVM
- Low latency (around 1 second for global consensus)

In the future, it will be possible to extend scalability even further through proven techniques such as sharding, state channel or side chains.

### Convex is Fun

We believe in providing a powerful, interactive environment for development in Convex that enables high productivity while maintaining secure coding principles.

Convex provides an interactive REPL allowing users to code directly on the Convex platform using Convex Lisp.
