Convex provides a powerful platform for developers of decentralised applications and digital assets.

This site is dedicated to helping developers get the most out of learning and using Convex.

- Use Convex directly! Create a free account and run transactions live at the [Sandbox](/sandbox). You can create smart contracts directly with our interactive REPL.

- Developers interested in decentralised technology, smart contracts and the power of the lambda calculus may wish to explore the documentation for the [Convex Virtual Machine (CVM)](/cvm).

- A set of tools provides analytics and interaction with the current
[Test network](/testnet).

We are an Open Source community, and discussion often takes place on the [Convex Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/xfYGq4CT7v). Join up for lively discussion, collaboration, announcements and more!
