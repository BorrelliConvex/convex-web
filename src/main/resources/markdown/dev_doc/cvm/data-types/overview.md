Convex provides a uniquely flexible data model. By understanding the following sections revolving around the different types of values supported by the CVM, users will
be able to combine those types to represent pretty much anything they can imagine. Once again, we strive for a minimalistic set of principles which can be used and reused at will,
providing a fun, pragmatic, and robust experience.

A particular data type is used for its intrinsic properties. For instance, numbers are used for mathematical computations while strings are used to represent text
and vectors are used to group together several values. Each section describes the properties of a particular data type with concrete examples, going from simpler ones to more complex ones.
Examples demonstrate how values can be manipulated using functions. As such, it is expected that users have minimal understanding of what a function is as described in the [syntax section](/cvm/syntax).
