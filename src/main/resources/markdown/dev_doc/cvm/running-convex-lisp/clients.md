The [Convex organization on Github](https://github.com/convex-dev) hosts a series of clients libraries allowing different programming languages and environments
to interact with the current Convex networkd. Either directly through the binary protocol supported by peers or through the [convex.world REST API](/rest-api).

    - [convex-dev/convex-java](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convex-java), REST API client
- NodeJS
    - [convex-dev/convex-api-js](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convex-api-js), REST API client
