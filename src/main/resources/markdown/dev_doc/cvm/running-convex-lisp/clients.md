The [Convex organization on Github](https://github.com/convex-dev) hosts a series of clients libraries allowing different programming languages and environments
to interact with the current Convex network. Either directly through the binary protocol supported by peers or through the [convex.world REST API](/rest-api).

## Directly

- Clojure
    - [convex-dev/convex.clj](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convex.cljc), Clojure toolset hosting a binary client
- Java
    - [convex-dev/convex](https://github.com/orgs/Convex-Dev/convex), main Convex repository hosting a binary client
