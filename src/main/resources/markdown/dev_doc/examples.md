This section showcases examples of smart contracts written in Convex Lisp, either by writing them from scratch, by using official
libraries and contracts deployed by the Convex Foundation, or both.

Overall, reading and understanding sufficiently the [Convex Virtual Machine](/cvm) section is a prerequisite. However, one can
naturally have a look at the examples first to get a sense of where all of this is going. Examples can be executed in the
[sandbox](/sandbox) if desired, albeit some values might need adjustments.

It is important to understand that those are only a few selected examples. We hope they will provide guidance for your own ideas
and projects.
