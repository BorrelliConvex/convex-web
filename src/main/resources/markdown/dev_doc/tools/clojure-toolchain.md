As exposed previously, [core JVM libraries](/tools/core) make any aspect of the Convex stack accessible to any JVM language.

Given this fact, Convex and the Clojure programming language are a unique and perfect match. This is not surprising since some of the
design decisions behind Convex Lisp were modeled around concepts stemming from Clojure and the world of functional programming.
An obvious example is the pervasive usage of persistent data structures at the root of Convex Lisp and the whole data model
promoted by Convex.

Hence, the Clojure toolchain offers wrappers for the core JVM libraries with extra capabilities. It allows users to easily combine
the excellent and highly productive Clojure ecosystem with the excellent and highly versatile Convex network.
