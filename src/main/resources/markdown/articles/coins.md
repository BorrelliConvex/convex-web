## Convex Coins

### The need for cryptocurrency on public networks

Public consensus networks create value by providing shared, trusted and cryptographically secure state to participants globally. This capability is valuable, but costs real resources to provide: 

- Organisations and individuals around the world must dedicate storage, compute and network infrastructure to operate the network.
- Use of the network beyond a certain level can cause congestion, imposing costs and delays on other users

Hence we need a way to regulate usage of the network
