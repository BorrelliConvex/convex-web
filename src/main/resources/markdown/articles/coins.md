## Convex Coins

### The need for cryptocurrency on public networks

Public consensus networks create value by providing shared, trusted and cryptographically secure state to participants globally. This capability is valuable, but costs real resources to provide: 

- Organisations and individuals around the world must dedicate storage, compute and network infrastructure to operate the network.
- Use of the network beyond a certain level can cause congestion, imposing costs and delays on other users

Hence we need a way to regulate usage of the network

### Denominations

#### Copper

Copper coins are the smallest, indivisible currency unit on Convex. They aren't individually useful, except as a way to accurately specify fractional amounts of other coins.

#### Bronze = 1,000 copper

Bronze coins are worth 1000 copper. They are typically enough to pay fees for small transactions (transfers, calls of simple smart contracts).

#### Silver = 1,000 bronze

Silver coins are worth 1,000,000 copper. This is enough to pay for quite complex operations on-chain, e.g. deploying new smart contracts or allocating data.
